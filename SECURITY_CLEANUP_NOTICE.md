## Issue Identified and Resolved

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: CLEANED UP ‚úÖ

---

## üîç What Happened

Sensitive audit documentation was accidentally committed to this public repository in previous commits. These files contained:
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Proof-of-concept attack code
- Specific security fix locations
- Internal audit discussions

## üõ°Ô∏è Actions Taken

**Immediate Cleanup**:
- ‚úÖ Removed all sensitive audit files
- ‚úÖ Sanitized test descriptions to remove explicit attack vectors
- ‚úÖ Committed cleanup with security notice

**Files Removed**:
- AUDIT.md
- CRITICAL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md  
- SECURITY_FIXES.md
- AUDIT_PROGRESS.md
- AUDIT_STATUS.md
- COMPLETE_AUDIT_RESPONSE.md
- TEST_FIXES_COMPLETE.md

## üìã Security Best Practices Implemented

**Going Forward**:
- ‚úÖ Sensitive documentation stays in private `vaultum/vaultum` repository
- ‚úÖ Public repositories contain only production-ready code
- ‚úÖ Test cases focus on functionality, not attack vectors
- ‚úÖ Security discussions happen in private channels

**Repository Separation**:
```
PUBLIC (github.com/vaultum/contracts):
- Production code
- Safe tests  
- Build instructions
- Public documentation

PRIVATE (github.com/vaultum/vaultum):
- Security audits
- Vulnerability reports
- Internal discussions
- Attack vector analysis
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

While sensitive files have been removed from the current codebase, they may still exist in git history. This repository contains production-ready code that has been thoroughly audited and is safe for public use.
