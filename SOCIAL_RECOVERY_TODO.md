# ðŸ“‹ Social Recovery Module - Completion Checklist

## Current Implementation Status: **~70% Complete**

### âœ… Completed Features
- [x] Basic guardian management (add/remove)
- [x] Recovery initiation and voting
- [x] 48-hour timelock mechanism
- [x] Auto-adjusting threshold
- [x] Recovery execution
- [x] Owner cancellation
- [x] Two-phase guardian addition (security fix)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (32 tests)

### ðŸš§ Missing Core Features

#### 1. **Weighted Voting System** (Priority: HIGH)
```solidity
struct Guardian {
    address guardian;
    uint256 weight;  // 1-3 votes per guardian
    bool isActive;
    uint256 addedAt;
}
```
- [ ] Update Guardian struct to include weight
- [ ] Modify voting logic to use weights
- [ ] Update threshold calculations
- [ ] Add weight validation (max 3?)

#### 2. **Emergency Freeze** (Priority: HIGH)
```solidity
function emergencyFreeze() external onlyGuardian {
    // Requires majority of guardians
    // Freezes all transactions for 24-48 hours
    // Notifies owner
}
```
- [ ] Add freeze state tracking
- [ ] Implement freeze voting mechanism
- [ ] Add unfreeze function for owner
- [ ] Block execute() during freeze

#### 3. **Guardian Rotation Requirements** (Priority: MEDIUM)
```solidity
uint256 constant GUARDIAN_ROTATION_PERIOD = 365 days;
mapping(address => uint256) lastRotation;
```
- [ ] Track guardian rotation dates
- [ ] Enforce periodic updates
- [ ] Send rotation reminders
- [ ] Allow grace periods

#### 4. **Enhanced Recovery Features** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Multiple recovery requests queue
- [ ] Recovery request expiration (30 days?)
- [ ] Guardian replacement during recovery
- [ ] Partial recovery (change specific permissions)

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Requirements

#### Guardian Management Interface
- [ ] Add guardian form with weight selection
- [ ] Guardian list with status indicators
- [ ] Pending guardian approvals
- [ ] Guardian activity history

#### Recovery Interface
- [ ] Initiate recovery button for guardians
- [ ] Recovery progress tracker
- [ ] Approval status dashboard
- [ ] Timelock countdown timer

### ðŸ”§ SDK Integration

#### JavaScript SDK
```typescript
class SocialRecoveryClient {
  async addGuardian(address: string, weight: number)
  async removeGuardian(address: string)
  async initiateRecovery(newOwner: string)
  async supportRecovery()
  async getRecoveryStatus()
}
```

#### PHP SDK
```php
class SocialRecoveryClient {
  public function addGuardian(string $address, int $weight)
  public function removeGuardian(string $address)
  public function initiateRecovery(string $newOwner)
  public function supportRecovery()
  public function getRecoveryStatus()
}
```

### ðŸ“š Documentation Needed
- [ ] User guide: "How to set up Social Recovery"
- [ ] Guardian guide: "How to help recover a wallet"
- [ ] Best practices for choosing guardians
- [ ] Recovery scenarios and examples
- [ ] API documentation

### ðŸ§ª Additional Testing
- [ ] Weighted voting scenarios
- [ ] Emergency freeze flows
- [ ] Guardian rotation edge cases
- [ ] Gas optimization tests
- [ ] Integration tests with UI

|------|--------------|----------|
| Weighted Voting | 4-6 hours | HIGH |
| Emergency Freeze | 3-4 hours | HIGH |
| Guardian Rotation | 2-3 hours | MEDIUM |
| UI Components | 8-10 hours | HIGH |
| SDK Integration | 4-6 hours | MEDIUM |
| Documentation | 3-4 hours | MEDIUM |
| **Total** | **24-33 hours** | - |

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of Done
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] UI allows full guardian management
- [ ] SDKs support all recovery operations
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] Gas costs optimized and measured
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] 100% test coverage maintained
